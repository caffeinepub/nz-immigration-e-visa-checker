  "summary": "All five requirements (REQ-1 through REQ-5) are implemented in the diff. The backend actor stores visa applications with all required fields, provides a query function, and includes sample data seeding. The frontend implements a validated form, displays status results with visual indicators, and uses a professional government-style design with navy/gold color scheme, proper typography, and official portal aesthetics.",

      "reason": "The BuildRequest explicitly states 'Do not implement real authentication beyond Internet Identity if needed' as a constraint, and authentication is not mentioned in any requirement. However, the diff includes full Internet Identity provider setup (useInternetIdentity.ts hook, InternetIdentityProvider wrapper in main.tsx, and actor authentication logic in useActor.ts).",

The form collects all three fields but only uses referenceNumber for lookup.",
