# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Create a New Zealand immigration e-visa status checking website where users can look up their visa application status by entering application details.

**Planned changes:**
- Build backend actor to store and retrieve visa application records (reference number, passport number, date of birth, status, application type, submission date, last updated date)
- Create visa status check form with validated input fields for application reference number, passport number, and date of birth
- Display visa application status results with all relevant information in a clear, organized layout
- Design professional government-style interface with formal color scheme and clear typography that conveys official trustworthiness
- Add backend seeding function to initialize sample visa applications with various statuses for demonstration

**User-visible outcome:** Users can enter their visa application details into a professional government-style portal and view their current application status, submission date, and other relevant information.
